⚠️ What's Partially Working (Use With Caution) 
Strategy Builder 

     What it's supposed to do: Let you create trading strategies by mixing indicators
     Current issues: Sometimes the signals don't work right, strategies might not execute trades
     Workaround: Use manual coding (like the example I provided) instead of the builder
     Status: Has bugs, but you can still create strategies manually

📚 Is the New Documentation Accurate? 

Yes, mostly. The new documentation is honest about what works and what doesn't: 

     ✅ Accurate about working features: Data collection, backtesting, optimization all work as documented
     ✅ Honest about problems: Clearly states the Strategy Builder has issues
     ✅ Clear about future plans: Lists all planned features that aren't implemented yet
     

The documentation doesn't pretend everything is perfect - it tells you exactly what's working and what needs work. 
🎯 So What Can You Actually Do Today? 

You can: 

    Collect data from Bybit (historical and live) 
    Create trading strategies using manual coding (not the builder) 
    Test your strategies against historical data 
    Find the best parameters for your strategies automatically 
    Manage your API keys safely 

You CANNOT yet:

Live trade (trade with real money)
Use AI features (machine learning trading)
Use the Strategy Builder reliably (it has bugs) 
    Live trade (trade with real money) 
    Use AI features (machine learning trading) 
    Use the Strategy Builder reliably (it has bugs) 

📝 Simple Summary 

Think of it like this: You have a research and testing platform that's fully functional, but the actual trading features are still being built. You can do all the prep work (data collection, strategy testing, optimization) but you can't execute trades yet. 

The documentation accurately reflects this - it shows you what you can do now and what's coming later.
